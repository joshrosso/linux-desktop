# Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running ssh-agent(1).  If this option is set to yes and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are
# added to the agent with the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add(1).  If this option is set to ask, ssh(1) will require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program before adding
# a key (see ssh-add(1) for details).  If this option is set to confirm, each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the -c option was specified to ssh-add(1).  If this option
# is set to no, no keys are added to the agent.  The argument must be yes, confirm, ask, or no (the default).
